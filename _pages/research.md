        We are a data-driven research group uncovering missed layer of gene expression - beyond what the genome annotation tells us. Our work focuses on discovering non-canonical proteins and hidden translation events that play critical roles in human disease. Using high-throughput data and computational approaches, we aim to rewrite the annotations of translation regions throughout the genome.
